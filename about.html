        <h1>Cafe in one place!</h1>
        <p>
            The Cafe is a franchise of Holding Universal Franchising, which joined the group in 2016, receiving a new concept that today is the main reason for its success.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Much more than a cafeteria of speciality coffees, we have become specialists in providing unique moments and creating good memories through sensations and aromas that convey the best memories of our lives.
            <br>
            We are a family-owned and operated business.
            <br>
            We spread the culture of Caf√© Especial and with our Emporium, we bring the best of Brazil, and now around the world.
            <br>
            We are a family-owned and operated business.
            <br>
            To be at Cafe is to tune in with yourself. It is to reestablish ties. It is disconnecting from the world while enjoying one of our famous cafes. It is to taste flavours that extract a beautiful and prolonged smile.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Sensory experiences and our entire environment go beyond making good coffee for you. The aroma of coffee that runs through the corridors connecting you to the place, all the rusticity, pictures and writings that make you understand that there is passion there and that everything has a story ... a reason for each thing and each person there. receives you in such a unique way to make you want more coffee and a good conversation.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            This is our reason.
            <br>
            We are a family-owned and operated business.
            <br>
            Cafe is a place with unique characteristics that leads you to experience it as a whole. Creating and reviving memories that are fixed in your mind and taste.
            <br>
            We are a family-owned and operated business.
            <br>
            This is our wonderland.
            <br>
            This is Cafe.
